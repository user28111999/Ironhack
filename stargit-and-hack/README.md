# LAB| GIT, CSS & HTML - Stargit and Hack

## Introduction

Welcome to Stargit and Hack !
You have learned the very basics of html, css & git throughout the prework and you can already make some pretty cool websites !

The focus of this lab is to introduce you to pair programming and assess what you got from the prework or if you have any prior experience.

This exercise will allow you to work in collaboration on your first project in which, you and another Ironhacker will present themselves !

Collaborating with git is a little abstract at the start so don't worry if you struggle with it at the start, the earlier you get & resolve conflicts, the better.

## Submission

- [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repo
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you use class and id selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify every element of that type
- Once you are ready to turn the lab in:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "done"
git push
```

- Create a pull request

## Tips

- For the Iteration n°1, it's recommended to work as 1 navigator / 1 driver
- Create 2 stylesheets otherwise you'll run into git conflicts if you're both editing the same stylesheet

## Instructions

### Iteration n°1

Requirements:

- A slogan/catch phrase of your choice
- 2 images (1 of each Ironhacker **side by side**), if you don't have one you can choose your power animal (animal fétiche)
- Why you came to Ironhack

Please find a screenshot of the expected results below:

### Iteration n°2

Create 2 seperate html files (1 per hacker) in which you will need to have at least:  

- Your name / surname
- Hobbies

After that, you have **_carte blanche_**.  
You can use javascript / css animations etc... if you already have some prior experience. :)
